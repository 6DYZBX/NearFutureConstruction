====================================
NEAR FUTURE CONSTRUCTION PACK v0.5.5
====================================

This pack contains structural components suitable for building impressive looking deep space vessels and stations. This means large trusses, structural adapters, multi-adapters and radial adapters. It is part of the Near Future Technologies set of packs, so works great with any or all of them.

============
DEPENDENCIES
============

Required
- InterstellarFuelSwitch (v1.15)
- Community Resource Pack (v0.4.3)

Optional
- ModuleManager (v2.6.5)
- Community Tech Tree (v2.0+)

============
INSTALLATION
============

I recommend removing any previous installations of Near Future Construction beforehand.

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.

I recommend the use of the Community Tech Tree (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0), which will place some of the fancier parts in higher tech nodes.
