This pack contains structural components suitable for building impressive looking deep space vessels and stations. This means large trusses, structural adapters, multi-adapters and radial adapters. It is part of the Near Future Technologies set of packs, so works great with any or all of them.

I recommend removing any previous installations of Near Future Construction beforehand.

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.
